TODO:
    Add user permissions to database
    Update crypto module to remove deprecation warning
    Add image storage and retrieval.. S3 buckets?
    Refactor db.js in etl and db2.js in models. (Combine?)
    Time for isValidDate in models/observations is not UTC
    Add csv ingestion (with try catch block for non csv files)
    Observations that have both a partial and complete are validated, when they
        need to be put to pending, otherwise a partial ID will be in the
        database?
